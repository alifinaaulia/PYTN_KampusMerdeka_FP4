## Project Overview

### Credit Card User Segmentation Prediction

In today's competitive banking industry, companies must develop sophisticated marketing strategies for their banking products. Market segmentation is a crucial strategy in the business world, grouping products based on similarities, common interests, and customer needs. Effective marketing strategies through precise market segmentation can significantly influence credit growth.

### Dataset

The dataset used is the Credit Card Dataset, which includes transactions from 9,000 credit card users over a period of 6 months, encompassing 18 attributes.

### Streamlit Application
